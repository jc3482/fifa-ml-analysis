## Overview

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of FIFA player data focused on two key questions:

1. **Regression**: Predicting player market value using physical, technical, and reputational attributes.
2. **Classification**: Predicting a player's preferred foot using dribbling and movement-related features.

We apply multiple statistical learning techniques including feature selection, regularization, tree-based models, and dimensionality reduction.
